## Project Overview  
This project analyzes three major film datasets: IMDb, Amazon, and Netflix, with a focus on evaluating movie ratings, sales, and genre distribution across platforms. Our goal is to uncover key trends, correlations, and anomalies in these datasets to better understand the factors influencing movie success.

## Research Objectives  
- Identify which genres consistently perform well across platforms.  
- Analyze the impact of actors and directors on movie performance.  
- Examine how release trends correlate with revenue and audience ratings.  

## Methodology  
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Processed raw datasets to remove inconsistencies.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to analyze trends.  
- **Visualization**: Created graphs and charts to interpret movie industry trends.  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Action and Adventure genres dominate revenue, while Drama and Documentary receive higher average ratings.  
  - A significant rise in movie releases post-2015 coincides with the rise of streaming services.  

## Technologies Used
